# Web Design 1 - Final Project


## Overview

Using the provided design, write the HTML and CSS to build out the page. The design can be found within the screenshot folder in the repo below.




## Getting started

Fork and clone this repo down to your local environment


The repo only contains a screenshot and asset images from design. This requires you to:

- Create an html file (including the boilerplate code).
- Create a css file and place it within a css folder.
- Write all semantic HTML included in the provided design.
- Apply styling to elements to match the design.

You can either follow the design and use the colors and Google font suggested or add a personal touch. You are not to change the layout or arrangement of content.

If you would like to swap out images and content to showcase your work (which I would obviously love to see), please use the same image sizes as provided to keep everything consistent with the assets provided. Remember if you are creating assets (image files) they have to follow our naming conventions when naming the files. Example: 'portfolio-1.jpg' NOT 'Portfolio 1.jpg'




## Requirements:
- Create a separate folder for your CSS file
- Use a Google font of your choice for the webpage. If you are not interested in sourcing one or adding a personal touch, you can use 'Open Sans' - bold and regular.
- The maximum width of the container is 1280px. This would be applied to each section (preferably using a reusable class like 'wrapper').
- Color values used in the layout: #0E1215, #FAFAFA #000 and white
- You can choose font sizes (remember to set as rem)
- You are also free to decide on margin and padding; just keep it consistent
- Use of CSS Grid properties for a minimum of one element
- Use of CSS Flexbox properties for a minimum of one element
- Follow proper folder structure and naming conventions
- Demonstrate semantic HTML using appropriate elements for your content
- Use jump links to bring user down to correct section when clicked in the navigation
- Correctly apply CSS properties (Google font, background colors, font color, font sizes, etc..)
- Apply default, visited, hover and focus states for links
- Apply accessibility features where required (ex. landmark roles, alt attribute, aria-label, etc..)
- Webpage developed as close to design as possible.
- HTML code is valid (https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- CSS code is valid (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
- Indentation is applied properly to both HTML and CSS
- Correct link to GitHub Pages site submitted to Brightspace. Marks will be lost if you do not have your GH Pages enabled.
- Descriptive commit messages - no 'update index.html file' repeated 10 times

Be sure to reference the assignment rubric to confirm you are completing all required work to receive full marks.

Note: There are a number of ways you can position elements but for this assignment I would like you use CSS grid and flexbox to arrange content using the layout in the design.

Please do not use inline/inline-block/block and/or float property. We have not covered the position property but I realize some of you may be familiar with positioning absolute or relative. You cannot use that either. Must be Flexbox or CSS Grid.
